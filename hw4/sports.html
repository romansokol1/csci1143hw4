<p>"Kyudo" is a Japanese martial art in which the mind and body are trained through a series of conduct in shooting a Japanese bow and arrow at a target. It developed long ago as Kyujutsu (the art of Japanese archery) for tactics and military art, and today it's also considered a sport or a healthful exercise. Meanwhile, some schools from ancient times still exist and are preserving the traditional school while coexisting with modern Kyudo. </p>

<ol type="1">
	<li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumi">Bow</a></li>
	<p>The bow, or <i>yumi</i> is 7 feet long and made up of laminated bamboo. The grip is 1/3 towards the bottom. The grip point of the bow is at a vibrational node of the bow - around 1/4 and 3/4 points of the bow from the ends. The grip is right there at a 3/4 point to avoid vibration from the recoil fouling the shot. </p>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya_(arrow)">Arrow</a></li>
	<p>The arrow, or <i>ya</i> is up to a meter long, this allows the bow to be drawn to the shoulder as oposed to the cheek.
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyūdō">Uniform</a></li>
	<p>The bow is drawn with the thumb, a <i>yugake</i> (the glove), is necessary</p>
	<p> The uniform itself is called the <i>obi</i>, <i>sash</i>, and <i>hakama</i>or split skirt, with either a kyudo-gi, or jacket, or a kimono for the higher ranks.<p>
	<p>The women would often time wear a leather covering called a <i>Muneate</i> to protect the breasts from the release of the string.</p>
